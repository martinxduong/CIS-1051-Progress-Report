Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've created the layout of the game, I have the working game but only in one set mode. I have the background, pictures, characters, etc. and the game works.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Create the main menu for the game, create settings for the game, create an easy mode and hard mode for the game. The play again popup is very generic and I have I can change it.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

When bananas overlap, they look a bit glitchy, and I cannot make the game full screen or the game becomes off centered.
